  Hi, I’m Tom — a senior software engineer who thrives at the intersection of clean code, data scalability, and developer experience. With 6+ years of experience in enterprise software, I've led projects that modernized data architectures, automated developer workflows, and saved millions in infrastructure costs.
    <br>
    <br>
  At Intuit, I re-architected core systems to transition from legacy data platforms to S3-based lakes, created tools like Testable to boost developer productivity, and enhanced deployment pipelines that improved iteration speed and reliability. I care deeply about testing excellence, scalable design, and quality at every layer.
    <br>
    <br>
  Whether I’m mentoring junior engineers or optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I bring a balance of hands-on technical skill and big-picture thinking. I'm currently looking for my next opportunity to build impactful systems, improve developer experiences, and continue growing alongside a great team.

  Aside from work there are a few things I enjoy doing in my free time: music production, playing music, hiking, astronomy, video games, and tinkering.
