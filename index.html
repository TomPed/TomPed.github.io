  I am currently a Candidate for a Bachelor of Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics at Northeastern University in Boston. I'm currently mentoring incoming computer and information science freshmen and tutoring students in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs3500/">Object-Oriented Design</a> and have a strong passion for quality when developing software. I am also a soon to be member of the Ultimate Frisbee team.

  Aside from school and work there are a few things I enjoy doing in my free time: surfing, exercise, astronomy, hiking, neural networks, technology news, and game development.
