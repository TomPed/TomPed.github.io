Gone are the days of fighting over the aux, shouting your song suggestion across the room, or switching which device is connected to Bluetooth.
Now you have Viibe. Viibe is an iOS app that allows a host to create a Viibe and allow their guests to connect to the Viibe via a code so everyone has a say in what music plays.
