At Intuit, I led the development and adoption of a new Tax Tool that transitioned the team from an outdated Vertica system to a modern S3-based data lake—cutting infrastructure costs by seven figures while improving speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction. I built Testable, a tool that generates realistic, secure test data for TurboTax’s data pipelines, reducing creation time from hours to minutes and boosting overall pipeline reliability. I also improved DB Deploy by enabling dataset-level deployments, reducing complexity and speeding up iteration by decoupling test dependencies. On the data side, I refactored critical join logic in our experimentation metrics engine (Scala + Spark), swapping expensive DataFrame joins for a reduce-union-grouping strategy. This change slashed EMR runtime from 3 hours to 20 minutes and eliminated job failures. Beyond code, I mentored two new hires as an onboarding buddy—helping them ramp up quickly, navigate internal systems, and feel confident asking questions from day one.
