My time spent at Intuit was working on TestEasy - a tool that allows testers to test TurboTax flows. I ran usability
tests and deployed TestEasy on AWS, using React, Java, MySQL, and CloudFormation with 100% code coverage and UI automation tests.
I also mentored the next group of incoming interns rotating on to the TestEasy team. Aside from TestEasy,
I launched two tools, Codecov and HipTest, on AWS using docker images, RDS, and CloudFormation. While these tools were awesome to work on,
nothing tops the week long hackathon Intuit put on. I was the Lead for TurboPulse - the third runner up project. I really
loved this week because I was able to learn a lot about being a leader and gaining the confidence to pitch ideas infront of a room of people.
