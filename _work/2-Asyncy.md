Asyncy is an open source microservice choreography as a platform. Asyncy allows you to develop fully micro-scalable services with built in metrics and logging.
While on the team I developed a [handful of microservices](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aasyncy+org%3Aasyncy+fork%3Atrue) for developers to use along with
[multiple sample apps](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aasyncy-example+org%3Aasyncy+fork%3Atrue) built in [StoryScript](https://docs.asyncy.com/storyscript/) to run on Asyncy.
I also worked heavily on the [Microservice.Guide](https://microservice.guide)'s [CLI](https://github.com/microservice-guide/cli).
Aside from all of this great tech, I would have to say my favorite part of this internship was learning how to become an entrepreneur.
Since Asyncy is a startup I was able to gain an unbelievable amount of knowledge from [Steve Peak](https://stevepeak.net) this founder of Asyncy.
