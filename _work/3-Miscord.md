Miscord is a bot for the voice service [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that takes user input via the Discord chat and will reply with a message, photo, or play a voice file depending on the input. While creating the bot I was able to learn more about Node, setting up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), and Amazon Web Service auto deployment.
