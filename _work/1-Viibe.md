Gone are the days of fighting over the aux, shouting your song suggestion across the room, or switching which device is connected to Bluetooth. 
Now you have [Viibe](http://viibe.fm/). Viibe allows people to connect to a community playlist, throught a Facebook Messenger Bot (soon to become a native iOS and Android app), with a five digit pin and start adding your music.
