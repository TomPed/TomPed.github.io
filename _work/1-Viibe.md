Gone are the days of fighting over the aux, shouting your song suggestion across the room, or switching which device is connected to Bluetooth. 
Now you have [Viibe](http://viibe.fm/). Viibe is an iOS app that allows a host to create a Viibe and allow their guests to connect to the Viibe via a code so everyone has a say in what music plays.
