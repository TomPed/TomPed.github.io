My last co-op was at [Analytical Graphics Inc.](https://www.agi.com/) where I was a part of the Cesium team and work on the [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) product. Cesium is an open-source JavaScript library for world-class 3D globes and maps. Whilst on the Cesium team I learned a handful of skills. Some of these skills include: Git, Node, [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), and the workflow of GitHub (PR's ect.).
