    Photography.
</h1>

Photography is a great way for me to explore the world and express myself. I decided to take a photography course at Northeastern so I can learn more about photography, and, you know, up my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_username }}">Instagram</a> game. Most of my photos are taken in the Greater Boston area, and I seem to have a theme of simple frames that provoke thought.
